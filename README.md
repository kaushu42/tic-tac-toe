# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game I'm creating.
Currently you can add X's and O's anywhere on the screen.

Created using SFML.

To run this project:
    1. Install SFML
        In ubuntu, type:
            > sudo apt install libsfml-dev
        Look for instructions to install SFML in windows elsewhere.
    2. Make the project
        In a terminal, type:
            > make
    3. An executable file called 'main' will be generated. Run it using:
            >./main
