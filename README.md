# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game I created.
You can play against another player.
The game exits when someone wins. The winner is displayed on the console.
When a draw occurs, the game restarts.

Created using SFML.

To run this project:

    1. Install SFML
    
        In ubuntu, type:
        
            > sudo apt install libsfml-dev
            
        Look for instructions to install SFML in windows elsewhere.
        
    2. Make the project
    
        In a terminal, type:
        
            > make
            
    3. An executable file called 'main' will be generated. Run it using:
    
            >./main
            

Todo:

    [x] Create a playable 2 player game
    [] Add scores to the game
    [] Add AI to the game
